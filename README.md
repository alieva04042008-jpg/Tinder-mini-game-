Description:
This is a simple Python-based mini dating simulator inspired by Tinder. The program interacts with the user by asking for their name and gender, then presents a selection of characters. The user can “like” or “dislike” each character.

Purpose of the Program:
Finding “the one” in real life is hard…but in this game, there’s no need to stress! Meet a bunch of quirky characters, swipe left or right, and just have fun seeing who catches your eye.

To-Do List:
1)Install Pygame and set up the program.
2)Make a welcome screen and ask for the user’s name and gender.
3)Add character pictures and basic info.
4)Show characters on the main screen.
5)Let the user “like” or “dislike” characters.
6)Keep track of liked characters.
7)Show which characters the user liked at the end.
8)Add simple animations or effects for likes/dislikes.
9)Test the game and fix bugs.
